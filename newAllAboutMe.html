                <td1>First I want to say thank you for coming to my website, I really appreciate it!
                My name is Mario Nava and I am currently 17 years old. My brithday is on January 1st 2000,
                crazy I know! I am currently a senior and attend<a href="http://www.alvordschools.org/hillcrest"> Hillcrest Highschool</a>. Some facts about me
                are that I am the third oldest out of my 12 siblings. Yes i said 12 siblings, its a very big
                and complicated family. My favorite color is blue, however when it comes to wearing a color 
                its red or black. I started my own iphone screen repair buisness (which you can check out by
                clicking the <a href="newbusiness.html">"buisness"</a> tab at the top of this page) and I fix iphones with my great friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thecheeze312/">Cory</a> 
                to make some extra cash. I am very "smart" kid and have averaged a 4.4 gpa throughout
                highschool so far. I really hope you enjoy my websites and if there are any suggestions or problems you have you 
                can leave them down below in the survery! Thank you once again for visiting my website. </td1>
